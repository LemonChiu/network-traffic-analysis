# Visualization of abnormal flow analysis

##[Online Demo](http://lemonchiu.github.io/network-traffic-analysis/)

### Introduction

This is the project for [2015 ChinaVis Data Challenge](http://chinavis.org/2015/index_challenge.html).

#### Tasks
Given a week's TCP data transmission log of a company, find the servers and clients in its internal network. Analyze the network architecture and summarize the network communication modes.

#### Data Source
A Company's network log in a week.

![Demo Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LemonChiu/network-traffic-analysis/master/screenshot/network_traffic_analysis_overview.png)

The visual analytic system, utilizing the "Over and Detail" method, integrates the chord diagram, bubble chart and several other visualization, as well as user interaction techniques. It provides the ability to do visual analysis of the visits and the traffic statistics of network nodes, which leads to the partition of clients and servers. Then, according to the visualized characteristics of different period of time and different communication protocols, we can speculate the use of the servers and classified them. Finally the pattern of the network communication will be concluded.
